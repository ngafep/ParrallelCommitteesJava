To perform the necessary tests of the “Parallel Committees” database architecture, in addition to the presented theoretical analysis, the protocol was implemented as a simulator software. Through the use of this simulator, it was illustrated that in a distributed database employing the PBFT consensus mechanism to process client requests, the proposed architecture significantly enhances the number of processed requests per second as the network scales in terms of the number of nodes. In contrast, without the proposed architecture, a substantial decrease in the transactional throughput of the same PBFT algorithm is experienced with an increasing number of nodes.
